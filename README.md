HCI Project 4 - Health Concierge

This presents a repository of our path from initial system design to working product of a Google Assistant enabled health concierge application.

The contents of this repository contain the progress and finished product of web application dashboards that can be opened via voice or text commands prompted by the Google Assistant.

The two main components are represented as the <strong>google-assistant-logic</strong> and the <strong>health-concierge-app</strong>. We also include in this repository the Google Assistant System Design Documentation for the reader to understand the workflow between interaction from <strong>USER</strong> to <strong>ASSISTANT</strong> to <strong>CONCIERGE</strong>. An updated proposal and project introduction is included as well.

The working copy of the health concierge app dashboard can be viewed here: https://d2awussa5so553.cloudfront.net/ which serves as an interface for the Google Assistant interactions for the dashboard, telemedicine services, and the pharmaceutical delivery.

Thank you,

Daniel Hwang, Judy Zhang, Ride Bu
